# Anime Face Generator using DCGAN

## Overview
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate unique anime faces. The DCGAN model is trained on a dataset of anime face images, learning to generate new faces that mimic the style of the training data.

## How it Works
DCGAN is a type of generative model that learns to generate data by training on a dataset of examples. It consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. 

- **Generator**: The generator takes random noise as input and generates new images. During training, it learns to produce images that resemble the training data.
  
- **Discriminator**: The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator. It learns to classify images as real or fake.

The two networks are trained simultaneously in a competitive process: the generator aims to produce realistic images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to become better at distinguishing real images from fake ones.


## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of anime face images collected from various sources. The dataset consists of thousands of high-quality images representing different anime characters and styles. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset).


## Results
After training the DCGAN model on the anime face dataset for a certain number of epochs, the generator learns to produce realistic anime faces. The generated faces exhibit diverse characteristics and styles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in capturing the essence of anime art.
